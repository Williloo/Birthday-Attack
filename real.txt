Confession left with my lawyer to be publicly disclosed should I disappear:
I have hidden some gold bullion underneath the globe statue of the globe lawn at UNSW.
If you get ahold of this letter check that the hash matches the one I have given so you know this is the real location.
I have hidden my wealth in bullion for tax reasons.
When you are collecting the wealth, ensure that you are not seen by Campus Security.
I would recommend digging up the bullion during the Christmas Shutdown as there will be less staff.
When you have secured the bullion, do not store it for an extended period.
Sell the gold as quickly as possible and declare the money as a donation from my company.
