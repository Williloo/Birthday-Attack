Final confession to be passed on to the Chief Executive officer of my company should I disappear:
I have hidden some gold Bullion at Western Sydney University Cambeltown Campus.
I have hidden the treasure underneath the back of the main building in front of campus.
Dig the soil near the second pillar to the left and you will find the box of bullion.
I have also hidden other peieces of my wealth with their location described in a letter hidden with the bullion.
I have hidden my wealth in bullion for tax reasons.
When you are collecting the wealth, ensure that you are not seen by Campus Security.
I would recommend digging up the bullion during the Christmas Shutdown as there will be fewer staff and students.
When you have secured the bullion, do not store it for an extended period.
Sell the gold as quickly as possible and declare the money as a donation from my company.
Ensure that the gold is sold quickly and the money is spent incrementally so as to not raise suspision from the ATO.
